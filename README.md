Backup of my personal test ground. Mostly algorithms.

#### My personal steps on solving programming problems.
1. Write of the solutions you are thinking.
2. Write elementary (even baby) steps process of the solution you are thinking. Best written in the IDE as a comment.
3. Implement you code following the steps.

I find this easier because sometimes my mind flies somewhere else and this solution makes it easier to go back to where I was disturbed. 

## ArrayRemove
- Removes an item in an Array using it's index. Learned why ArrayList are mostly used xD

## PalindromeDetector
- Detects if a word is a palindrome or not. Palindrome are word that are the same if reversed sample, racecar. First I thought of reversing the array and then comparing them. But I thought of simultaneously checking the first and last to the middle instead because it's much easier. Learned that its better to think of all possible solution before solving the problem.
