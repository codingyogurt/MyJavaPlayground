# MyJavaPlayground
Backup of my personal test ground. Mostly algorithms.

## ArrayRemove
- Removes an item in an Array using it's index. Learned why ArrayList are mostly used xD

## PalindromeDetector
- Detects if a word is a palindrome or not. Palindrome are word that are the same if reversed sample, racecar. First I thought of reversing the array and then comparing them. But I thought of simultaneously checking the first and last to the middle instead because it's much easier. Learned that its better to think of all possible solution before solving the problem.
